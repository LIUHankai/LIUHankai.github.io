# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am currently a lecturer at the [College of Cryptology and Cyber Science](https://cyber.nankai.edu.cn/), Nankai University (南开大学密码与网络空间安全学院), China. Prior to this, I earned both my B.E., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Tianjin University, China. During my doctoral studies, I was supervised by [Prof. Xiulong Liu](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/liuxiulong/index.html) (刘秀龙) and [Prof. Keqiu Li](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likeqiu/index.html) (李克秋), with my research primarily focused on mmWave sensing and sensing security. For my master's degree, I was supervised by [Prof. Yongtao Ma](https://faculty.tju.edu.cn/MaYongtao/zh_CN/index.htm) (马永涛) and Prof. Kaihua Liu (刘开华), with a concentration on RF mobile localization.

My research interests include **Wireless Sensing** and **RF Security**. I have published over 20 papers at the top-tier international conferences and journals, including ACM IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE TWC, IEEE TAP, etc. I hold several academic positions such as TPC Member of TrustCom 2025 and Workshop Chair of ICA3PP 2023.

📢📢 <span style="color:red;">I am seeking research assistants to work on multiple research projects related to mmWave Sensing and Side-channel Attacks. Drop me an email if you are interested. Candidates with a background in AI, Communications, or Electronics are preferred.</span>
